                    <b>Technology Internship Program at Capital One</b><br>
                    During my time as a Technology Intern at Capital One, I was apart of the team that runs the Commercial Data Refinery. 
                    My main area of concern was the efficiency of the metrics (or jobs) running through the refinery. Every day, around 1800
                    jobs are run through the refinery, and data about the jobs are collected, such as the cloud resources they use, the amount of 
                    resources they utilize, their statuses, and etc.. <br> The idea for the intern project was to create a User Interface that displays
                    information about the jobs run through the refnery, including cost analytics and statuses of jobs. This would help provide more 
                    transparency with the Data Analysts without having direct database access. My part of the overall project were as follows:
                    <br> <br>
                </center>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Worked with MySQL to aggregate data about metric runs, or "jobs", into one table to get resource utilization information and distribution of resources given to each in AWS.</li>
                        <li>Created a cost algorithm to determine the cost of the jobs ran.</li>
                        <li>Developed an API to display the database information and calculate the cost of each and return different endpoints which were then displayed via a React application. The API would return histories of a specific metric run, and allow the user to specify how far back the records went. It also returned history of refinery daily runs, which were sorted by the highest cost. </li>
                        <li>Migrated the MySQL database to PostgreSQL in hopes of utilizing materialized views for better performing data aggregation.</li>
                        <li>Deployed the API via AWS, using a Capital One pipeline.</li>
